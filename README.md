## Hi there 👋, I'm George 

I am a second year uni student studying Software Engineering/Computer Science with an interest in web/software development and cyber security.

This profile is to share some personal projects that I have worked on, and to build my portfolio
- 🎯Portfolio Website: [Portfolio](https://geogeo116.github.io)
- 📨You can reach me on LinkedIn: [Get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgemcnamara2006/)


Currently, I still have basic projects, but I hope to bring more advanced projects to show soon.
- I am currently working on a text-based Java alien game!
- I am currently learning front-end development

### Programming languages and Tools
I have varying levels of experience with the following languages and tools, but I hope to learn more in the future
